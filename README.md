# POL-346-Projects

These projects were made for a Princeton Course, titled POL 346: "Applied Quantitative Analysis." This was a project based course that focused on teaching how to conduct statistical analyses on social science datasets, with an emphasis on linear and logistic regression, data cleaning, and data visualization. These projects were both written in R.

The first project, in the folder "2016 Election Report" was an analysis of voting patterns in the 2016 presidential election, aiming to stdudy whether economic anxiety was a strong predictor of support for Donald Trump in the election, and if such attitudes were more predictive of Trump support than racial resentment or xenophobia. 



The second project, in the folder "Mental_Health_Study" examined whether exposure to anti-suicide education actually ncreases youths' chances of considering suicide, which is a debate amonge experts in psychology and education.
